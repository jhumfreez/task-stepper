# Form/Task Stepping Workshop

## Description

This is an idea workshop for redesigning a sequence of forms, that will be identified as tasks or steps (the naming is fairly inconsistent, apologies in advance).

Along the way I stumbled upon the Material Stepper component, which I found fairly complex to use for my tastes, but learning how to use it was insightful and inspired some of the changes. Not essential, but convenient none the less.
